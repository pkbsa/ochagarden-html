He had two brothers, older brother Scott Summers and younger brother Gabriel Summers. All three were mutants. When Scott and Alex were boys flying home from a family vacation in their father's vintage private plane, a scout ship from the alien Shi'ar Empire suddenly materialized and set the plane ablaze. Katherine pushed Scott and Alex out the plane door with the only available parachute. The parachute caught fire, so Scott used his mutant optic blasts for the first time to slow their descent. Scott and Alex were unaware that their parents had been teleported from the plane by the Shi'ar a moment before it exploded.Scott suffered a head injury on landing that damaged the part of his brain that would have enabled him to control his optic blasts. The two boys were hospitalized and both suffered traumatic amnesia regarding the incident. They left the hospital after two weeks and were placed in the State Home for Foundlings, an orphanage in Omaha, Nebraska and were subjected to a battery of tests and experiments by the orphanage's owner, Mr. Milbury, an alias for the evil geneticist and their future enemy Mr. Sinister. Sinister believed that Scott was the Summers brother with the most potential, so he had Alex adopted to separate them and render Scott emotionally vulnerable. Alex had little or no contact with Scott until years later. Alex was raised by Andrew and Joanna Blanding, whose son Todd had been killed in a car accident. Alex was pressured to act as a replacement Todd, which he tried to do as best as he could. When Todd's killer Vincent kidnapped Alex and his foster sister, Haley Blanding, Alex manifested his mutant powers for the first time, incinerating Vincent. Mister Sinister appeared, quite surprised to find that Alex’s potential possibly exceeded Scott's. Unfortunately, Alex lacked any control over his powers. Sinister placed psi-blocks on both Alex and Haley, causing them to forget everything that happened that night. The immortal mutant Apocalypse encountered the non-mutant variant Ahmet Abdol and deemed him to be a broken, beaten man of great potential but without direction. Apocalypse acquired a sample of Alex Summers' DNA, insuring that its coding had been modified for his purposes, and had Sinister graft it to Abdol. The experiment was only partially successful and resulted in an unexpected and quite unusual symbiotic relationship wherein Abdol's power was split between them and not shared. Deciding to use his powers for his own personal gain, Abdol created a cult around himself as a messiah, the Cult of the Living Pharaoh, became a super-villain, and set about his plan to rule the world."

Horton, one of the pioneers in the field of artificial intelligence and robotics. The culmination of Horton's research was an android who mimicked virtually all of the functions of a human being, including independent thought, but was composed entirely of synthetic materials.The one flaw in the android's design concerned the photoelectric solar cells called Horton Cells which covered every square inch of his body and served as his power source. The cells were too volatile and caused the epidermis of the android to burst into flame upon contact with air but without harming the android itself. Horton revealed the Torch's existence to the public at a press conference in November 1939, at which he demonstrated how the Torch would burst into flame if he introduced a small amount of oxygen into the transparent container in which he was confined. The news media proclaimed the Torch to be a potential menace, and so after a presidential order,[8] Horton buried the android in his supposedly airtight tube within cement until such time as he could find a way either to prevent the android from bursting into flame or learn how to control its flame.There was a slow leak in the tube, however, and eventually enough oxygen entered so that the android's flame ignited explosively, permitting him to escape. Wreaking havoc in innocent exploration of his environment, the android, inaccurately dubbed the Human Torch, soon realized the panic he was causing and, unable to control his flaming power, doused his flame in a swimming pool. In his infancy, the Human Torch was duped by a crook named Anthony Sardo into committing crimes. Realizing what he was doing was wrong, the Torch confronted Sardo and during the fight was doused in nitrogen which was the catalyst that allowed him to control his flame from that point on.In attempting to bring Sardo to justice, the criminal was killed in battle. When Horton suggested that the two use his powers to obtain fame and fortune, the Torch rejected this idea, leaving Horton's home a flaming inferno which seemingly killed the scientist. However he would resurface later, alive and well."

Then Ajax, angered by Wilson’s taunts, lobotomized Worm, the closest thing Wilson had to a friend. At Death’s prompting, Wilson killed Worm to end his suffering. However, under Killebrew's rules, any patient who killed another was to be executed; Ajax subsequently tore out Wilson’s heart and left him for dead, but Wilson’s thirst for vengeance was so strong that it jump started his healing factor, regenerating his heart, although not curing his scarred body.

When he was still a child, Harry had his soul bargained by his father with the demon Mephisto in exchange for making his financial life more successful. With the deal closed as a result of this bargain, Harry was destined to suffer numerous personal tragedies when he reached adulthood, and when he died, he would have his soul sent to Hell. Harry grew up friends with Gwen Stacy at Standard High before going off to college.[6][7] The two of them quickly befriended Flash Thompson when they arrived at Empire State University, but also adopted Flash's disdain for the reclusively scholarship student, Peter Parker, initially taking Peter's distant behavior as snobbery. However, he soon realized Peter was merely shy and distracted by his aunt May Parker's health problems. Harry's relationship with his father was always strained, and it became worse when Norman secretly became the super-villain known as the Green Goblin. Harry and Peter Parker became closer as Peter consoled Harry over his father's distance, while Peter as Spider-Man was regularly fighting Norman as the Green Goblin.[9] When Parker and Osborn learned each other's identities, Norman suffered amnesia after the fight, and Peter hid the Goblin costume for Harry's sake. He circulated a story that Norman Osborn was injured helping Spider-Man defeat the Green Goblin once and for all. Parker came to the hospital afterwards to check on Norman and make sure his amnesia held up. Harry misinterpreted this gesture as a sign of friendship, and things permanently thawed between Harry and Peter. Harry and Peter became friends and started rooming together near campus. They began regularly seeing Gwen and Mary Jane Watson in group settings and on double dates, with Peter and Gwen, and Harry and MJ slowly becoming exclusive.[12] Harry Osborn had hid himself away for weeks in order to grow his new ""face fuzz"".[13] He would later shave it off.[14] Harry's relationship with Mary Jane didn't sail smoothly, though.

When his father died in action as the Green Goblin after killing Gwen Stacy, Harry found the body and removed the costume. He refused to attend Gwen's funeral and chased away Mary Jane as he began to obsess over Spider-Man."

As the younger sister of the X-Man Colossus,[12] she was forcedly taken to Limbo by the malignant Belasco when she was under the X-Men's custody.[13] In the very few seconds that passed on Earth, Rasputin aged years in Limbo, a process which caused her to master different dark arts.[14] Back to the X-Men, Magik exhibited mutant teleporting abilities linked to Limbo and ultimately joined Charles Xavier's younger protegees, the New Mutants. Having the New Mutants not only as her teammates but also as her close friends, Magik experienced many unimaginable adventures and difficult moments. Her usually mischievous attitude always masked a deeply traumatized and lonely soul.[16][17][18] After sacrificing herself to prevent Limbo from corrupting Earth, Rasputin recovered her innocence by being reborn as the child she was before being kidnapped.[19] Tragically, she was infected by the deadly Legacy Virus[20] and passed away soon later.[21] Through Belasco's machinations, Rasputin was later revived without her soul.[22] Taking control over Limbo,[23] she manipulated the New Mutants to recover her lost soul.[17] This ordeal reapproximated her to the X-Men and she eventually joined their ranks as a relevant agent.[24] Concurrently, Magik also became closer to the magic superheroic community after being mentored by Doctor Strange. More recently, Magik has found a passion for teaching, having been appointed one of the Great Captains of Krakoa, where she's in charge of training and leading mutants to battle.[27][28][29] In addition to that, she also teaches magic at Strange Academy."

Horton (the man who would later create the original Human Torch), was an expert on flameproofing who was conducting experiments with asbestos. Longtime exposure to asbestos ruined Raymond's health, and he left Horton's employ. Soon afterward, Raymond married Nora Jones, a scientist who was herself seriously ill from overexposure to radium in her experiments. They honeymooned in Mexico, and nine months later on May 6, 1924,[5] their son Thomas was born. They nicknamed him ""Toro,"" the Spanish word for bull, as a private joke, in memory of the bullfights they had seen on their honeymoon. As Thomas grew into boyhood, his parents realized that they would probably die from their illnesses before he became an adult. However, they discovered that Thomas was immune to fire, and Nora theorized that he was a mutant,[citation needed] but it wasn't, in fact, a mutant gene, but a recessive Inhuman gene that gave him his abilities.One day, Raymond's home was invaded by a costumed criminal named Asbestos Lady and her gang. The Asbestos Lady utilized fire in her crimes, protecting herself with asbestos, and intended to force Raymond to develop new means by which she could use asbestos for crime. The Human Torch, who had been watching the Raymonds' home, suspecting that the Asbestos Lady would contact such a noted authority on asbestos, broke in and captured the gang. However, the Asbestos Lady escaped. The Human Torch learned about Thomas' immunity to fire from his parents, and decided to keep watch over the Raymonds, both to protect them from the Asbestos Lady and to monitor Thomas' development. Soon afterward, Fred Raymond learned that his wife had only a few more weeks to live.[3] When the Human Torch revealed himself to Fred, he blamed the Torch for somehow cursing his son with flame powers that he could not control and ordered him out of his house. He kept the news from her and instead hurriedly arranged a vacation trip for the family, which would be Nora's last. They embarked on the trip by train, but the Asbestos Lady, obsessed with making up for her failure to capture Raymond, had a huge tree trunk placed on the tracks. The train hit the trunk and was derailed and wrecked.[3] Fred and Nora Raymond died when the train burst into flames, but Thomas escaped. A married team of circus fire-eaters, Tom and Ellie Alexander, were driving by and saw Thomas rushing into the flames unharmed to try to find his parents. Moved by both sympathy for the orphan's plight and by the realization that he would prove a boon to their act, the Alexanders decided to take him under their wing."

In their first such experiment, proposed by Ikor, a delegation of four brought atomic energy knowledge to the planet Prosilicus. The Prosilicans accepted the gift, but used it to develop nuclear weapons and engaged in an auto-genocidal war. Ashamed of their actions, the Watchers vowed never again to interfere in the affairs of other races.[3] Uatu tried to convince Ikor, his father, that his deeds were noble, despite the outcome, but the words fell on deaf ears. After the Prosilican incident, Ikor drafted a code of ethics based upon strict noninterference and passive observation.[5] Uatu asked his father if their vow of non-interference would be a hindrance to races that were in serious danger. Ikor advised his son that no matter what, they should never interfere in the affairs of another alien world ever again. Now calling themselves the Watchers, they traveled the universe viewing everything they encountered. Thousands of years later, Uatu came across a situation that tested the vow of his people when he witnessed the Yrds disposing of atomic waste by jettisoning it into space, potentially threatening some other distant world with destruction. Uatu watched the mass of atomic waste for decades when one day he witnessed a supernova jettison a rogue planet into space. Uatu witnessed as the planet struck the cloud of atomic waste, destroying both. This reinforced in Uatu's mind that his father was right, that they should leave things to fate.[5] Eventually, the Watchers assigned themselves onto the moons of various inhabited worlds to observe activities there. Uatu was assigned to the planet Earth and constructed a citadel on the Blue Area of Earth's moon.[6] Not only did Uatu watch history on Earth, but also took an interest in viewing his chosen world in alternate universes.[7] His initial intentions were also to find a reality where his people did not make their grave error, however, to date, Uatu has yet to find such a reality.Uatu -- or simply the Watcher as he became known -- had his first recorded encounter with an Earthling in the year 1602 AD, when a possible-future Captain America was inadvertently sent back in time to that era causing ripples in the time-stream that threatened the very fabric of reality. Uatu revealed the nature of the problem to an Elizabethan-era version of Dr. Stephen Strange who helped send the temporally-displaced Captain America back through a time-portal, correcting the timeline.[8] Uatu's superior, however, allowed the divergent timeline, Earth-311, to persist in a pocket dimension."

As a teenager, he was chosen at random by the alien Rhomann Dey, last surviving Centurion of the planet Xandar's elite Nova Corps, to inherit his power and succeed him in the rank of Nova Prime following the destruction of his world by the intergalactic pirate Zorr. Having been mortally wounded in the battle that tore Xandar apart, Dey succeeded in tracking Zorr to Earth, but he was unable to exact vengeance himself due to the extent of his injuries. At death's door, Dey had little choice but to transfer his power to an unsuspecting human on the planet below, gambling that whoever he found would be willing to take up his cause and prove worthy of the powers he had given their recipient. The sudden infusion of power overloaded Rider's body, and he was hospitalized. While Rider was comatose, the moribund Rhomann Dey explained to him telepathically what had happened to him and what his mission was. Rider's recovery was as sudden as his incapacitation had been, being preceded by eye-blasts that knocked a doctor out of his room. Discharged, he tried to resume his normal routine. But the very next day, Rider was alone in his bedroom when Dey suddenly transmitted to him Dey's last gift to Rider, his Centurion's uniform. Rider discovered that he now possessed super strength, near invulnerability, the power to fly, and a uniform with a sealed life-support system, but with little instruction as to how to use these new powers. Indeed, he barely had the opportunity to test out these powers before radio circuitry contained in his uniform's helmet alerted him to Zorr, who was on a rampage in the heart of New York City. Rider was able to locate Zorr and engage him in combats, although he was unable to fatally wound Zorr. Using a telepathic link Dey was able to use Rider to lock onto Zorr's location. Dey then teleported Zorr aboard his Nova-Ship and used the energies of its Computer P.R.I.M.E. to disintegrate Zorr, leaving behind only the alien's life-support suit. The energies of the Computer P.R.I.M.E. are so powerful that Dey's body was itself destroyed in the process. Rider, having taken up the mantle of Nova, was enamored with his newfound abilities, albeit he did not have the any idea as to how he was supposed to use them. Still, he took up the life of a superhero, fighting costumed enemies such as the Condor,[18] Powerhouse,[18] Diamondhead,[19] the Corruptor,[20] and others in New York as he gradually learned how to use his new powers. After a brief career as ""Nova: the Human Rocket,"" he was called into space to serve in the protection of the recently reconstructed planet Xandar, where his powers originated. Eventually, his life of constant intergalactic war was beginning to become tiresome. Hoping to rejoin his high school friends, Richard Rider requested to return home to Earth. When he was told he had to relinquish his powers in order to do so, to which Rider agreed.For a time, Rider lived a relatively normal life. Working in a fast-food restaurant kitchen, he was barely able to make enough money on which to live due to his disrupted education. He spent his time trying to pick up the pieces of the life he had left behind, all the while wishing he could find a way to regain the powers he lost. During this period, the planet Xandar was destroyed again in an attack by the space pirate Nebula, unbeknownst to him."
